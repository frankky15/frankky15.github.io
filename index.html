									Hi! I'm Franco, but you can call me Frankky...
									<br>
									<br>I'm 24, I live in Argentina, and I'm a self-taught software developer.
									<br>Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by everything, especially technology.
									I was the kind of kid that wanted to know how everything works, even if that got me
									in trouble.
									<br>I can only say, I've disassembled way more things than your average little guy,
									and... also broken way more things too.
									<br>
									<br>My programming path started long ago, but the kickstart was about two years ago when I
									took a course on Videogame Development and learned C#.
									<br>About a year ago, I wanted to take things a bit more seriously. I wanted my code to look
									cleaner, easier to read, and more efficient.
									<br>So I started learning other things, a bit of JS, some CSS, HTML...
									To get a grasp, or a better understanding of how OOP really worked and how to get the most out
									of C#.
									<br>Eventually, I dived into APIs, Web Apps, and some data managing.
									<br>At that point, I'd already decided I wanted to make a career out of it, so I started learning
									ASP.Net Core...
									<br>
									<br>Nowadays I work with my dad in a little machining shop run by my family.
									<br>And in my free time, you can almost certainly find me working on some project,
									tech-related or not.
									<br>For example, some recent unrelated projects include...
									<br>A motorized tricycle built from scratch... well, it's still unfinished but it's getting there...
									<br>A complete driving sim setup, reverse-engineered a pair of VR goggles
									and even built my own HID device.

								<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Retail Management Solution:</h3>
								<p>
									I found a sample database for a bike shop and decided an RMS web application would be a great use of it.
									<br>It is an integrated solution that adopts the Repository-Service and MVC Patterns, using Entity Framework
									with a custom implementation of users that binds to the sample database.
									<br>It implements roles, and each role is packed of features that are well documented in the instructions.
									<br>The app is divided into a Production section, a Sales section, and an Administration section. Some of the
									features of the production section are managing products, brands, categories, and updating stock.
									<br>The Sales section has features oriented towards managing orders and customer info.
									<br>As for the Administration section, it has features to manage staff members and each store location.
									So it also supports multiple locations.
									<br>Another great feature it has is a point of sale (POS) integration, so you can make orders straight from
									the app.

								<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Task Management System:</h3>
								<p>
									A SUPER simple Demo MVC web application I built to teach myself how to make a data access layer from scratch,
									and that was the challenging part. It has an in-memory database that uses JSON as storage.
									<br>It showed me how to properly handle errors in a very sensitive part of the code.
									<br>It adopts the Repository-Service Pattern and also has a very basic implementation of an 
									authentication system that uses sessions.
									<br>In essence, it really showed me how a raw, well-structured application looks like.
